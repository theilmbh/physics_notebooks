The reason for the minus sign is that positive normal stress indicates a pulling along the normal direction, and we think of positive pressure as a \"pushing\" or \"compressing\" force.  This is just a convention, and the results are equivalent no matter which sign you use, as long as you are consistent!"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we have defined the notions of stress and strain for a continuous material body under the assumption of small deformation gradients.  We applied Newton's laws to derive partial differential equations describing the relationships between stress, strain, deformation, and mechanical equilibrium.  We applied a relaxation technique to solve for the equilibrium deformation of a continuous body deforming under its own weight, subject to non trivial boundary conditions.  We visualized the resulting deformation, and found that it matched our intuition. We used our results to compute the pressure and shear stress distribution inside the material, providing insight into the mechanics of continuous bodies.\n",

    "I hope you try to play around with the parameters and boundary conditions.  You will be able to identify when the assumptions of the model break down, but also you could simulate more interesting scenarios than we have here. For example, what if the mateiral was dangling from a ceiling? Or what if the material was a bar stretched between two anchors, like a bridge?  Figure out what the boundary conditions would be in these cases, and make guesses as to what the deformations and stresses should look like. Do they match your intution?\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, this example was taken from chapter 13 of Benny Lautrup's \"Physics of Continuous Matter\", which I can't recommend enough.  If you can get a copy, there are plenty of analytic examples that will help you understand continuum and fluid mechanics in a multiude of situations that come up in every day life. \n",
